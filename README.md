# Industrial Copper Modeling Application

## Overview
Welcome to the Industrial Copper Modeling Application, a project focused on predicting selling prices and status in the industrial sector. This application utilizes machine learning techniques to provide insights into industrial copper pricing and status prediction.

## Problem Statement
The copper industry deals with less complex data related to sales and pricing. However, challenges such as skewed and noisy data can impact the accuracy of manual predictions. This project aims to address these challenges by implementing machine learning regression models for predicting selling prices and classification models for predicting the status (WON or LOST).

## Skills Developed
- Python scripting
- Data preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Streamlit web application development

## Usage Instructions
1. Choose the "Predict" option from the menu.
2. Select whether you want to predict selling price or status.
3. Enter the required input parameters.
4. Click the "Predict Selling Price" or "Predict Status" button to get the results.
